Dream I That Dream You saw light And moved like an animal Through three waves.The foam Left a divide On the sand, And you sang And watched your hands and feet And said, No this is a dream. But I became a tree. So please, Wake me from this Mountain Sway. Carry me Tirelessly Bounding and leaping Beyond these heavenly slopes. Dream II I will hide under a mountain tree And wake thee with heavy breath. When bird and wind make no sound And nothing moves And with pearl And fire of my eye Carry you Rippling and running From this mountain side. Dream III Let Wind sway And dream slip To Nature. Foam slips the finger too, Like snake discarding skin.And you think, Over and over, I am deep rooted on this hillside. But where there is sun Wait patiently As oil and water pop, One by one, And I run. Dream IV Delicate bark and leaf Have no sense And forest looses Self Leaping from mark to mark, In stride, Well below and beyond My hillside. Where In pink and white blossom I stand alone In stone And tall Lingering grasses. Dream V Don’t think It’s anything more Than leaves In wind At night With stars, Against your White and pink blossoms, That I run Endlessly ‘til day And Between rock and blue sky Like clouds Upward with wind Again ‘til night. Dream VI Alone with blue And grey passing whisks For some time, I see not the hillside, Nor distant shores, Where you run To lay At my Side, Warming my colors, As they fade, Day after day. Dream VII I am The pink in your flower Before and after it’s gone, And the bow In your branch When I blow Upward against My backbone at night, Whistling I am sleeping On your moss, And your roots, And all your delicate fibers,Dreaming… I have always run, I have always run, I have always run.
